This repo holds the code for [Creating Coding 2.0](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3862-creative-coding-2-0-in-js-animation-sound-color/units/14951-skewing). You can see all final sketches [here](melahub.github.io/creative-coding/).

## Create a new sketch
To get creative with a single js file, run `canvas-sketch canvas-sketch/[js-file-name-withou-extension] --new --open`, `canvas-sketch` will bring up a server the renders all changes without the need of reloading the page at every save.

To bring back up an existing sketch, run `canvas-sketch canvas-sketch/[js-file-name-withou-extension]`.

## Run locally
`npm run dev`
